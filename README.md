Steps:
A mutual fund plan is created by selecting the stocks where an investor can benefit in the long term. Hereâ€™s the process we can follow to create a mutual fund plan:

- Step 1: Gather historical stock data, such as closing prices and growth trends over time.
- Step 2: Calculate key metrics like Return on Investment (ROI) and volatility (risk) to understand how each stock has performed historically.
- Step 3: Choose stocks that have a high ROI and low volatility to ensure a balance between risk and reward.
- Step 4: Calculate the future value of monthly investments based on the expected ROI of the selected stocks.
